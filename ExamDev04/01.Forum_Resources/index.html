                Stay away from those people who try to disparage your ambitions. 
                Small minds will always do that, 
                but great minds will give you a feeling that you can become great too.

                Success is peace of mind,
                 which is a direct result of self-satisfaction in knowing you made the effort to become 
                 the best of which you are capable.

                Teamwork is the ability to work together toward a common vision. 
                The ability to direct individual accomplishments toward organizational objectives. 
                It is the fuel that allows common people to attain uncommon results. 
                Individual commitment to a group effortâ€”that is what makes a 
                team work, a company work, a society work, a civilisation work.
