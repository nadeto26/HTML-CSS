        <h1>Greetings from Narnia!</h1>
        <p class = "main">I hope this finds you well! Narnia is even more magical than I imagined. 
            The landscapes are breathtaking, and I've met the most fascinating creatures, 
            including Aslan himself. Every day here is an adventure. 
            I visited Cair Paravel and was awed by its beauty. I wish you could see it with me! 
            Sending you lots of love and a touch of Narnian magic. 
            Can't wait to share my stories when I return.</p>
